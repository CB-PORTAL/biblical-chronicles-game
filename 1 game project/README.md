# ðŸŽ® 1 GAME PROJECT

## Purpose
The beating heart of Biblical Chronicles - your complete Unity project workspace

## What Goes Here
- The entire Unity project created through Unity Hub
- All C# gameplay scripts (PlayerMovement.cs, DialogueSystem.cs, etc.)
- Unity scene files (.unity) for each Biblical chapter
- Prefabs for reusable game objects
- Unity packages and dependencies
- Project settings and configurations

## Folder Structure Inside
```
1 game project\
â”œâ”€â”€ Assets\
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Scripts\        (All your C# code)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Prefabs\        (Reusable game objects)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Scenes\         (Garden of Eden, Noah's Ark, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Materials\      (Visual effects, shaders)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Imported\       (Sprites/sounds Unity copies here)
â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectSettings\    (Unity configuration)
â””â”€â”€ Packages\          (Unity package manager)
```

## Use Cases
- Opening Unity Hub points here to load your project
- VS Code opens Scripts folder for coding
- Build your game executables from here
- Version control (Git) tracks this entire folder
- This is where the ACTUAL GAME exists

## Important Notes
- **NEVER** manually move files inside Assets - use Unity
- **ALWAYS** backup before major changes
- **KEEP** scenes organized by Biblical book
- **NAME** scripts clearly: `NoahArkBuilder.cs` not `Script1.cs`
