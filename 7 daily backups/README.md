## Daily Backup Ritual (Every Night at 10 PM)

### Quick Backup Script
Create `backup_today.bat` in main folder:
```batch
@echo off
set TODAY=%date:~-4%_%date:~4,2%_%date:~7,2%
set BACKUP_DIR="D:\biblical chronicles game\7 daily backups\%TODAY%"

echo Creating backup for %TODAY%...
mkdir %BACKUP_DIR%
mkdir %BACKUP_DIR%\screenshots

echo Copying Unity project...
xcopy "D:\biblical chronicles game\1 game project" "%BACKUP_DIR%\unity_backup" /E /I /Q

echo Copying artwork...
xcopy "D:\biblical chronicles game\2 character art" "%BACKUP_DIR%\art_backup" /E /I /Q
xcopy "D:\biblical chronicles game\3 background art" "%BACKUP_DIR%\art_backup" /E /I /Q

echo Backup complete! Don't forget to:
echo 1. Take a screenshot of today's progress
echo 2. Write in dev_journal.txt what you accomplished
pause
```

4. **Any visual bugs** (for debugging later)
5. **Successful milestones** (first NPC, etc.)

## Cloud Backup Strategy
Weekly upload to:
- Google Drive (free 15GB)
- OneDrive (free 5GB)
- GitHub (code only, not art)
- External USB drive

## Recovery Instructions
If disaster strikes:
1. Find most recent backup folder
2. Copy entire contents back to main folders
3. Open Unity and let it reimport
4. You've lost maximum 1 day of work!

## Milestone Backups
Special archives for major moments:
- `MILESTONE_first_playable_demo.zip`
- `MILESTONE_all_genesis_complete.zip`
- `MILESTONE_nft_integration_working.zip`
- `MILESTONE_beta_release_v1.zip`

## Storage Management
- Keep daily backups for 1 month
- Then keep weekly backups for 6 months
- Archive monthly backups forever
- Each full backup â‰ˆ 500MB-1GB

## Remember
"The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty." - Proverbs 27:12

**BACKUP EVERY NIGHT. NO EXCEPTIONS.**
